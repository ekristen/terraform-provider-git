# Git Helpers for Semver and Summary

Unfortunately the above project houses its code under `internal` so it cannot be directly imported by any
other project, therefore it has been copied to this plugin for use and exposed under `pkg/` so it can be
reused.

This package is provided as is, and has been modified slightly from the original. Happy to accept pull requests
but will not accept anything that drastically changes its behavior.
